  <h2>Why Choose Single Trip Travel Cover?</h2>
  <p>Any trip or holiday abroad should be covered by a good insurance policy which will protect you financially and medically should the worst happen whilst you are away.  If you only plan on taking one trip per year, then a multi-trip, annual policy is probably unnecessary and a single trip policy will be adequate cover.</p>

<p>A standard Single Trip Policy can cover circumstances such as cancellations, lost luggage and theft or damage of property, whilst additional cover can be added as required.</p>
